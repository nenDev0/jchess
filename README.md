## Description

This was a fun challenge to myself... I wanted to create a Chess-Bot and see, how good I could get it to be.
Turns out, not very good.

This project took me about 5 weeks full-time. And I mean full-time.
I forgot to eat sometimes.

## Project

### What the Project includes

- Java
- fully functional Chess-Game with reverse-function
- frontend to view and interact with the game
- a Chess-Bot, currently only set to play against another version of itself
- outdated and badly designed plantuml diagrams
- a... few bugs. :)


### What this Project does not include

- easy and intuitive customizability
- good documentation
- updated diagrams
- functional warranty
- promises for your eyes and brain to function after reading the code

### Requirements

- Java
- JUnit with Hamcrest-Core


### Future Development

- I make no promises of continuing development on this project
- I might rewrite it into C++ for more control and therefore performance enhancements
- if I find the motivation, large parts may simply have a complete overhaul

feel free to assist me in my effort


## Sidenotes (Don't @ me about these)

- For my projects, I make my own Coding Rules. I can simply read it better that way
- Yes. Some things in the code really make no sense. If I wrote this project again, I would do a lot of things very differently.
- I attempted to care about object-orientation, however at some points, I just wished it to work at all
